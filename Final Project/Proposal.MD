My final project will be to render a Double helix DNA strand that has texture. 
This strand will rotoate on its y axis spining around show the Whole strand. 
I will add DnA helix strand to my portfolio website. A stretch gaol is to 
have the strand be user controlled. I and maybe have a animal strand and when the strand is 
changed it can change the animal. BUt this is a very far stretch gaol I am not sure if I will 
even be able to get texture on to the DNA strand. 



Week 1: Collect information, images for MY DNA strand so I can know what type of code I will need. 

Week 2: Complete the necessary code to render the DNA strand and the begin with its rotation.

Week 3: Try to find texture for the images of the DNA strand the spheres will be easy but I am not sure how I will texture
the rods/ cilynders of the strand. 

Week 4: Once the texture is complete I will try to make improvements and clean ups the the DNA Strand and hopefully try to add
user controls to it. 
Week 5: (Stretch goal) and maybe and 2nd rotation if unable to add user controls and If I am far ahead I will try to add
a user control to change the DNA from Chiken to duck. while displaying a image in the window.
